Bonjour, Привет, Hallo, Zdravo, こんにちは

I go by the alias of SqL,

Making funny little projects to practice my programming skills.
I work a lot with: C, C#, Lua and Typescript (wish it could be only C tho 😔).

What is love? Editing text with Vim <3

What am I learning: 
- Trying to master C to create a game engine from scratch
- learning haskell to gather knowledge in the functional space,
- Building a deep understanding of the Computer,
- The art of note taking with org,
- Self learning Math & Physics,
- French.

This is a centralized place for all my work.
All my code (from now on) will be published under the BSD-Clause 3 license.
Meaning you can use my code to do whatever your heart desires.
